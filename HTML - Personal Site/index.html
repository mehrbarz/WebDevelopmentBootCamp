  <p><em> ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES <strong>UNIVERSALS</strong> </em></p>
  <p>The shape of the table is no better. We are all in the habit of judging as to the 'real' shapes of things, and we
    do this so unreflectingly that we come to think we actually see the real shapes. But, in fact, as we all have to
    learn if we try to draw, a given thing looks different in shape from every different point of view. If our table is
    'really' rectangular, it will look, from almost all points of view, as if it had two acute angles and two obtuse
    angles. If opposite sides are parallel, they will look as if they converged to a point away from the spectator; if
    they are of equal length, they will look as if the nearer side were longer.</p>

  <h3>Laws of Thought</h3>
  <p>They are as follows:
    <br>
    (1) The law of identity: 'Whatever is, is.'
    <br>
    (2) The law of contradiction: 'Nothing can both be and not be.'
    <br>
    (3) The law of excluded middle: 'Everything must either be or not be.'
